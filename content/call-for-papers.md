# Call for Papers

Who?
: Web researchers and engineers working on API servers and clients.

What?
: A full-day workshop on current and future challenges for Web APIs and their interaction.

Why?
: Web APIs are more important than ever, yet many unsolved problems demand our attention.

Where?
: Full-day workshop on 9 June 2016 – **paper submissions before 16 March 2016.**

Where?
: At the [ICWE conference](http://icwe2016.webengineering.org/) in Lugano, Switzerland.

## Scope
**Thousands of APIs** exist and their number is growing tremendously,
while use cases become increasingly complex.
In contrast to the _human-oriented_ part of the Web
that users consume with browsers, and with the help of standard mark-up languages such as HTML,
Web APIs are designed to be used by machines, which makes issues surrounding their design and integration
significantly diverse from that of the traditional Web, but also of most interest towards the provisioning of new added-value
automated solutions on the Web.
This includes emerging trends such as the Web of Things.

This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners
by providing an **open discussion forum** around the design and use of the **programmable Web**.
It is the principal venue for discussing latests findings and research and development results
around the **issues, practices, and best principles** surrounding Web API design and use.

## Focus Topics
We especially welcome research and engineering work in the following areas:

- **hypermedia-driven client/server applications**
- **Web API clients** that make use of controls and context in server responses
- Web APIs, platforms, and protocols for the **Web of Things**
- strategies to tackle the tremendous **growth and heterogeneity** of APIs
- **analyses and studies** around the practical, social, and economic factors surrounding the development, use, and adoption of Web APIs and mashups
- lessons learned from the **deployment, maintenance and evolution** of Web APIs and mashups
- automated **discovery, profiling, and testing** of Web APIs
- dynamic **combination** of and **interactions** between Web APIs

## All Topics
In addition to the topics above, this workshop is also open to:

- **applications** of the REST architectural style to novel domains
- **design patterns** and **anti-patterns** for Web APIs
- automated Web API **composition**
- **inverted REST** (REST for push events)
- integration of **pub/sub** with REST
- REST-compliant **transaction** models
- **frameworks** for Web API implementation and consumption
- **modeling** Web APIs
- **resource** design and granularity
- **evolution**, **versioning**, and **extension** of Web APIs
- **REST protocols** beyond HTTP

## Details and Dates
We welcome **full papers (up to 12 pages)** and **vision/demo/poster/breaking research papers (up to 6 pages)**, size counted in LNCS format.
Contacts with Springer are in progress to publish ICWE workshop papers in a ICWE 2016 satellite event post-proceedings as Lecture Notes in Computer Science.

Using the [LNCS template](https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0)
is the fast track to the camera-ready version,
but we accept publications in other formats, such as HTML or EPUB.
