# Call for Papers

Who?
: Web researchers and engineers working on API servers and clients.

What?
: A full-day workshop on current and future challenges for Web APIs and their interaction.

Why?
: Web APIs are more important than ever, yet many unsolved problems demand our attention.

When?
: Full-day workshop on June 6, 2016 â€“ **paper submissions before March 23, 2016.**

Where?
: At the [ICWE conference](http://icwe2016.webengineering.org/) in Lugano, Switzerland.

## Scope
**Thousands of APIs** exist and their number is growing tremendously,
while use cases become increasingly complex.
In contrast to the human-oriented part of the Web, Web APIs are designed to be used by machines.
This makes issues surrounding their design and integration
significantly different from those of the traditional Web.
However, this also enables the provisioning of **new added-value automated solutions** on the Web.

This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners
by providing an **open discussion forum** around the design and use of the **programmable Web**.
It is the principal venue for discussing latests findings and research and development results
around the **issues, practices, and best principles** surrounding Web API design and use.

## Pressing Topics
We especially welcome research and engineering work in the following areas:

- development of intelligent and generic **Web API clients**
- dynamic **combination** of and **interactions** between Web APIs
- novel **hypermedia-driven** solutions
- tackling the tremendous **growth** and **heterogeneity** of APIs
- analysis and understanding of the **social and economic factors**
  surrounding the development, use, and adoption of Web APIs and mashups
- novel solutions for the automated **discovery** and **profiling** of Web APIs
- novel technologies for facilitating the development of mashups and services for the **Web of Things**
- **lessons** learned from the deployment, maintenance and evolution of Web APIs and mashups

## All Topics
In addition to the topics above, this workshop is also open to:

- **applications** of the REST architectural style to novel domains
- **design patterns** and **anti-patterns** for Web APIs
- automated Web API **composition**
- **inverted REST** (REST for push events)
- integration of **pub/sub** with REST
- REST-compliant **transaction** models
- **frameworks** for Web API implementation and consumption
- **modeling** Web APIs
- **resource** design and granularity
- **evolution**, **versioning**, and **extension** of Web APIs
- **REST-protocols** beyond HTTP

## Details and Dates
We welcome **full papers (6 pages)** and **vision/demo/poster/breaking research papers (3 pages)**.
For your paper to be included in the official WWW companion proceedings,
the [ACM template](http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates) is required.
<br>
Accepted publications in other formats, such as HTML or EPUB,
will be published on the workshop's website.

Submissions are handled via EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wsrest2016.
