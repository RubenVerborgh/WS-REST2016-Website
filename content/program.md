# Program

## Overview

The workshop will begin with an invited **keynote speaker**,
followed by **paper presentations** that are encouraged to include **demos**.
These will be grouped into two main sessions
to fit within the overall break schedule established by the main conference organizers.
The workshop will close with a **discussion session**,
where a panel comments on the workshop papers,
summarizes the workshop discussions and outlines future research trends in this emerging area.
During the workshop, we actively encourage discussions
in order to stimulate the interest and participation among all attendees.
