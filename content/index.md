# Web APIs for a Web in evolution

The Web is changing at a tremendous speed, and **Web APIs** play an important part in that.
In fact, the number of Web APIs is growing so quickly that we face **many challenges**.

The WS-REST workshop series aim to **connect Web researchers and engineers**
to tackle the issues we are facing. Many of them are not solved by far:

- How to dynamically **integrate** Web APIs?
- How to create intelligent **clients** for Web APIs?
- How can we deal with the enormous **growth** and **diversity**?

These and many related [topics](/topics/) form the theme of WS-REST.
